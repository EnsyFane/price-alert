# Price alert

Price alert is a tool that you can use to get notifications when prices drop for certain items.

The main workflow should be:
  - Open app
  - Search for an item
  - Select from list items to track
  - Minimize app
  - The app will check every `x` minutes/hours/days to see if item prices dropped
  - Notification that price for an item has dropped will pop-up (or maybe receive email with item name, old price, new price and a link to the item)
